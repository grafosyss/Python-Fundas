Notes by - Kiran A Bendigeri

Hi, These are the notes and projects done by me,by referring several sources.

Ever since i saw a snail and got to know that it has got a shell which can be represented using mathematical model, i always thought there must be some
way to apply mathematical model to our every day events.
Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and Deep learning are the buzz words nowadays. I got fantasized by the beauty of new concepts and the way we can
train our computer to do intelligent task. I learnt these stuffs by myself reading several books, referring to youtube videos etc.

There are many good hearted people who have shared their knowledge.  

I hereby would like to give credits to the people below -
Andrew Ng
Siraj Rawal
Louis Serrano
Sentdex
A C Mueller
and many more...

P.S - This is my back up notes and anybody is free to use.
